# ThreatHunting

This repository contains my analysis of various malware samples uploaded to Malware Bazaar.

## Maturity Matrix
**In Progress**
The purpose of the maturity matrix is to determine the maturity of the malware based off of the following indicators Obfuscation, Attack Techinques & Functions called. 

| Indicators | Severity |
|------------|----------|
| Obfuscation | Low |
| Attack Technique | Low |
| Functions Called | Low |
| **Severity Score** | 3 |

### Severity Score
The severity score is assigned based of the overall severity of the malware. Each indicator can be categorized as `Low`, `Medium` or `High` where each category is assigned a number 1 to 3. See table below for score for each category. The severity score is the sum of all indicators. The score can be a minimum of `3` and a maximum or `9`. The higher the score the higher the higher complexity of evasion via obfuscation and attacks techniques used. 

| Severity | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Low | 1 |
| Medium | 2 |
| High | 3 |

### Obfuscation
The goal of this indicator is to determine the following:
- How well is the code obfuscated?
- Is the code obfuscated using mutliple obfuscation techniqnues? 
- What obfuscation technique(s) was used?

#### Severity: Low
No Obfuscation
#### Severity: Medium
- Functions & Variables are obfuscated(replaced with random strings or single letter)
#### Severity: High
- Multiple obfuscation techniques are utilized 
- Strings/data are encoded(base64, reversed, tokenized, customer encoding, encrypted, etc.)

### Attack Techniques
The goal of this indicator is to determine the following:
- How effective is the technique?
- What technique(s) were used?
- Were there chained techniques?
- How hard is the implementation/execution of attack technique?

### Functions called
The goal of this indicator is to determine the following:
- What functions were called?
- Using the [Malapi.io](https://malapi.io/) function categorization determine the
